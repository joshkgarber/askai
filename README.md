# Askai

A fast and convenient way to ask AI a quick question from the command line.

## Get Started

Install dependencies:

Assuming you have Bash already installed (or a bash-compatible shell interpreter), all that's left is to install Glow.

Refer to [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow/blob/master/README.md#installation) for installation instructions.

Run the install script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Read the usage instructions:

```bash
askai --help
```

## Tips

- It's a one-shot prompt i.e. there's no back-and-forth chat.
